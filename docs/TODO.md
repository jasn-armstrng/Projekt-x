### Digital canvas for the Sarajevo Street Art Festival

#### Introduction
'Sup Sarajevo,

The city is now a **DIGITAL CANVAS**. No hassle with the authorities or resident permission, **PAINT THE CITY WALLS, FLOORS, TRAMS...** from your screens - no cops, no cleanup, **SOME RULES APPLY** so we have no drama.

Your city breathes art - the walls, the streets, the food, the people - they all have a vibe that inspires, fuels, and colours life in Sarajevo. It's something **I**'ve felt from day 1.

For one week, leading up to the **SARAJEVO STREET ART FESTIVAL**, photograph and unleash your creativity here. Save your creations - share them with #sarajevostreetart, and add them to the public **GALLERY**. During festival week the gallery is going all across the city on **digital screens and billboards**, lighting up Sarajevo.

This is my respect to this city, to all you who make it what it is - express yourself and leave no surface behind.

What are you waiting for?
