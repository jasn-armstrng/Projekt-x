    <h1>'SUP SARAJEVO!</h1>
    <section class="intro-message">
      <p>The city is now a <strong class="emphasis">DIGITAL CANVAS</strong>. No hassle with the authorities, or resident permission, <strong class="emphasis">"PAINT" THE CITY WALLS, FLOORS, TRAMS...</strong> from your screens, no cops, no cleanup, <a href="terms.html"><strong class="link">SOME RULES APPLY</strong></a> so we have no drama.</p>
      <p>Your city breathes art - the walls, the streets, the food, the people - they all have a vibe that inspires, fuels, and colours life in Sarajevo. It's something <a href="about.html"><strong class="link">I</strong></a>'ve felt from day 1.</p>
      <p>For one week, leading up to the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/fasadafestival/?hl=en" target="_blank"><strong class="link">SARAJEVO STREET ART FESTIVAL</strong></a>, photograph and unleash your creativity <a href="paint.html"><strong class="link">HERE</strong></a>. Save your creations - share them with <strong class="emphasis">#sarajevostreetart</strong>, and add them to the public <a href="gallery.html"><strong class="link">GALLERY</strong></a>. During festival week the gallery is going all across the city on **screens and billboards**, lighting up Sarajevo.</p>
      <p>This is my respect to this city, to all you who make it what it is - express yourself, and leave no surface behind.</p>
      <p>What are you waiting for?</p>
