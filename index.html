      <h2>Own the Walls, Digitally.</h2>
      <p>No art school rules here, just raw expression. We're dropping a <a href="paint.html"><strong>DIGITAL CANVAS</strong></a> for you to hit the streets of Sarajevo like never before. Forget the hassle with the five-oh and the rush of real-world sprays â€“ this is your chance to <a href="paint.html"><strong>PAINT THE CITY WALLS AND FLOORS</strong></a> from your screen, no cops, no cleanup crews.</p>
      <p>Sarajevo breathes art, you know? It's that wild mix of old-school grit and new-wave energy, powered by something unseen that vibrates through these streets and the trams that ride 'em. We're talking that raw, undeniable energy that runs deep in this city's veins.</p>
      <p>So, for one week, leading up to the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/fasadafestival/?hl=en" target="_blank"><strong>SARAJEVO STREET ART FESTIVAL</strong></a>, this platform is your playground. Paint, express, make your mark. Save your creations, blast 'em on socials, or throw 'em into the public <a href="gallery.html"><strong>GALLERY</strong></a>. And here's the kicker: all your digital masterpieces are gonna get blasted across the city on **actual screens and billboards** during the festival. Yeah, your art, lit up for all of Sarajevo.</p>
      <p>This is my shout-out to this city, to all of you who make it what it is. A chance for every voice to echo on these digital walls, to claim a piece of Sarajevo, loud and clear.</p>
      <p>Let's go make noise!</p>
