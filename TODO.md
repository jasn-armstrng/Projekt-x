### Digital canvas for the Sarajevo Street Art Festival

#### Introduction
'Sup Sarajevo,

No art school rules here, just raw expression. This is a **DIGITAL CANVAS** for you to hit the streets of Sarajevo like never before. Forget the hassle with the authorities and resident permission â€“ **PAINT THE CITY WALLS AND FLOORS** from your screens, no cops, no cleanup crews, **NO DRAMA** .

Your city breathes art - the walls, the streets, the food, the people - they all have a vibe that inspires, fuels, and colours life in Sarajevo. It's something **I** felt from day 1.

For one week, leading up to the **SARAJEVO STREET ART FESTIVAL**, this platform is your playground. Paint, write, set your imagination free. Save your creations, share them with #sarajevostreetart, and add them to the public **GALLERY**. During the festival the gallery is going all across the city on **digital screens and billboards**. You'll light up all Sarajevo.

This is my respect to this city, to all you who make it what it is. A stage for every voice to be heard on the digital walls of Sarajevo.

What are you waiting for?
