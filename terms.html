    <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
    <section class="intro-message">
    <p>Welcome , your digital canvas for creative expression. Before you dive in and start painting the digital walls of our beloved city, please take a moment to read through these terms. By using this platform, you're agreeing to them, so let's make sure we're all on the same page!</p>
    <h4>Your Creative Freedom, Our Community Guidelines</h4>

    <p>This platform is all about celebrating Sarajevo's vibrant art scene and giving everyone a voice. We encourage you to be bold, be expressive, and let your imagination run wild. However, to keep this space inspiring and positive for everyone, there are a few things we absolutely can't allow:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No Hate Speech:</strong> Any content that promotes discrimination, hatred, or violence against individuals or groups based on their race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or any other characteristic is strictly forbidden.</li>
      <li><strong>No Pornography or Explicit Content:</strong> This is a public platform for all ages to enjoy. Any sexually explicit, obscene, or suggestive material will be removed immediately.</li>
      <li><strong>No Illegal Content:</strong> Content that promotes illegal activities, violence, or any other unlawful behavior is not permitted.</li>
      <li><strong>No Personal Attacks or Harassment:</strong> Respect is key. Don't post anything that harasses, bullies, or attacks other users or individuals.</li>
      <li><strong>No Commercial Spam:</strong> This platform is for art and expression, not for advertising products or services.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We reserve the right to remove any content that violates these guidelines, and repeated violations may result in your access to the platform being revoked. Let's keep it cool, respectful, and focused on art!</p>

    <h4>Your Data, Your Privacy</h4>

    <p>We believe in your privacy. Simply put, <strong>we do not collect any personal data from you when you use this platform.</strong> You can create, share, and enjoy the gallery with complete peace of mind, knowing that your activities here are not being tracked or stored in a way that identifies you personally. Weâ€™re here to facilitate art, not data mining.</p>

    <h4>Gallery Moderation</h4>

    <p>When you contribute your amazing digital art to the gallery, we're thrilled to showcase it to the world. However, to ensure that the public gallery remains a safe, inspiring, and appropriate space for all viewers (especially as it will be displayed on actual screens and billboards across Sarajevo!), <strong>all submitted images will be reviewed by our team before they appear in the public gallery.</strong></p>
    <p>This moderation process is in place specifically to ensure compliance with our content guidelines (no hate speech, pornography, etc.). We'll do our best to get your art live as quickly as possible, but please understand that there might be a short delay between submission and publication. If an image doesn't meet our guidelines, it won't be added to the gallery.</p>

    <h4>Let's Paint Sarajevo!</h4>

    <p>By participating, you're not just creating art; you're contributing to a unique celebration of our city's spirit. Thank you for being a part of this digital street art movement!</p>
